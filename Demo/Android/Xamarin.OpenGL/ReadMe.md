This is a OpenGLES demo for Typography.

# Usage

1. Deploy the app via Visual Studio.
2. Put a `TypographyTest.txt` file containing the text you want to display in root directory of your phone(NOT SD/TF card).
3. Open the app. The text will be shown at the top.

PS: The font file is fixed to DroidSans.ttf so only ASCII characters can be shown. This will be improved later.
